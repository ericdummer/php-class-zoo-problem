#You own a zoo! 

Your zoo is close to bankruptcy. Until the zoo is profitable, your rich brother said that he would pay the operating cost if his son can tour the zoo every day. His son, Timmy, gets very sad if the animals are not happy or have escaped. If Timmy isn’t happy, your brother isn’t happy. If your brother isn’t happy, he doesn’t pay.

You have another brother who is an animal activist. He believes no animals should ever be in a zoo. He wants you to close the zoo. Every night he sneaks in and moves all of the animals and takes their food.
