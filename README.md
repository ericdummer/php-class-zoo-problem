You own a zoo! The zoo is close to bankruptcy. Until the zoo is profitable, your rich brother said
that he would pay the operating cost every day if his son can tour the zoo every day. His son, Timmy
gets very sad if the animals are not happy or have escaped. If Timmy isn’t happy, your brother isn’t happy.
If your brother isn’t happy, he doesn’t pay. You have another brother who is an animal activist. He believes
no animals should ever be in a zoo. Every night he sneaks into your zoo and moves all of the animals and takes their food.

Extend the abstract class Animal. Then override and implement the necessary methods. Hint: look for @TODO in the parent class. Implement the interface ZooKeeper
which will move the animals back into the proper habitat and feed them.
